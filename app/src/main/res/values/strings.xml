	<string name="pref_info_is_low_ram_msg">This app toggles a few lines of code that was added in KitKat used by some
		apps to detect if a device is high-end or low-end and can use that to optimize
		it for the phone\'s less powerful stats.\nThis may have a major effect (results
		not guaranteed) that can speed up some apps when enabled, and allow you to use
		more features in those in trade for performance.</string>
	<string name="pref_info_is_low_ram_msg_expert">ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice() is a method introduced in Android 4.4 KitKat.
		It is used by some newer apps to enable simple or limited features to
		prevent slowing down an entry-level Android device and is flagged using a line in build.prop.\n\n
		This was added into the Android Support Library as ActivtyManagerCompat.isLowRamDevice().\n\n
		HOWEVER, it will always return false if you are on Jelly Bean (4.3) or below. This forces the 
		isLowRamDevice() to either return the default value, true, or false.
		When true, you can allow apps optimized for isLowRamDevice() to use the trimmed-down features
		which can improve performance, or if false, allows those said apps to load all features in trade
		for less performance.\n\nSee the developer docs for more info.
